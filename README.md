## Fully responsive Social Media Application Using MERN stack
### Motivation

In today's digital age, social media has become integral to our daily lives. People use social 
media platforms to connect, share, and communicate with others globally. However, many 
existing social media platforms have limitations, and users often need help with privacy and 
security concerns. Therefore, there is a need for a new social media website that provides users 
with a more personalized, user-friendly, and secure experience [1].
One primary motivation from a business perspective is that social media is a vital component of 
people's lives today. Social apps are, therefore, in demand. We can communicate with one 
another by creating a responsive social media app. Users can exchange thoughts, memories, and 
many other creative activities through this social media and networking app. Additionally, we
can acquire up-to-date tools and technologies in full-stack development and show off our 
proficiency in server-side programming, APIs, front-end development, database management, 
and other complicated data structures in our work portfolios. 
The main goal is to develop social media software that is easier to use and more responsive. It is 
comparable to other social media apps in the market; however, it is much easier to use than other 
apps.

### Significance

The project's significance lies in providing users a secure and user-friendly platform to share 
their precious memories. We will build a full-stack web application with the MERN, a powerful 
and popular technology stack [3].

This project is essential for several reasons:

- To give users a platform for sharing and saving their memories: People value their 
  memories, and this app will provide users with a platform to share those experiences with 
  others and preserve them for the future.
- Creating a full-stack MERN application with various features: It is a complex process 
  that demands a thorough understanding of modern web development tools to build a fullstack   MERN app with authentication, likes, dark mode, and a responsive design.
- Learning and applying various web development techniques: This project offers the 
  chance to study and use several web development techniques, such as React, MongoDB, 
  Node.js, Express, Material-UI, and JWT authentication.
- Minimalism: To create a social networking app that is simple to use and free of 
  unnecessary features that distract from the application's intended use.
- To add to the portfolio: Implementing this project will help us build our portfolio and 
  show prospective employers or clients my skills.
  
This project includes several distinctive features that set it apart, such as authentication, likes, 
dark mode, and a responsive design. However, rather than being a general-purpose tool, it 
concentrates on a particular use case: sharing and preserving memories. Lastly, cutting-edge web 
development tools have been used to create this web app, such as the MERN stack, a well-liked 
and full technology stack for creating full-stack online applications [4].
Overall the project offers a complete social media website built using the MERN stack, which 
stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. This web app aims to provide users a more 
personalized, user-friendly, and secure experience. Additionally, this web app can be a valuable 
resource for future developers looking to build their social media websites using the MERN 
stack.

### Objective

The main objective behind developing this social media web application is to build a bridge 
connecting people to facilitate accessible communication and effective social interaction. This 
Social media app will allow people to interact with each other and can be used for sharing news, 
events, wishes, opinions, and various other forms of information. Nowadays, social media apps 
have become the most used applications in our daily lives [2].
Our application has an interactive and fully responsive UI where you can post updates, including 
pictures or text messages. Any person following us can view our posts, send a like, and comment 
on them. In addition, we can follow any person of our choice and can also unfollow them.
We will use MERN to create the application consisting of Mongoose and Mongo DB for the 
database, React framework for the front end, and Express JS and Node JS for the backend. By 
the end of the development, we will be able to gain sufficient knowledge on building a full-stack 
web application using a single language, i.e., JavaScript.
One of the unique parts of this project is that everything in this project will be implemented from 
scratch. Hence, the objective is to get familiar with the recent tools and technologies and gain 
experience in the full-stack development sector while simultaneously providing Users with a 
unique, easy-to-navigate, clean-looking yet creative social media web app where they can share 
their memories or update their memorable moments or stories. Moreover, users can experience 
this from any device as this web app will be fully responsive and adjusted to any sized device.
We will also construct UML diagrams to design our application and any software development 
life cycle process flow method to develop our project.
