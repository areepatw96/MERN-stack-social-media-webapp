This a fully responsive socialmedia webapp using MERN stack

## Fully responsive Social Media Application Using MERN stack
### Motivation

In today's digital age, social media has become integral to our daily lives. People use social media 
platforms to connect, share, and communicate with others globally. For example, LinkedIn is for 
employment, Twitter is for news, Pinterest is for ideas, and Facebook is for connecting with friends 
and family. As a result, these platforms have a significant influence on their users [^5]. However, 
many existing social media platforms have limitations, and users often need help with privacy and 
security concerns. Therefore, there is a need for a new social media website that provides users 
with a more personalized, user-friendly, and secure experience [^1].
Our social media platform is a similar platform for sharing digital content. It is built using MERN 
(MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS) and other APIs and tools to create a responsive web 
application [^5].

Another motivation from a business perspective is that social media is a vital component of 
people's lives today. Social apps are, therefore, in demand. We can communicate with one another 
by creating a responsive social media app. Users can exchange thoughts, memories, and many 
other creative activities through this social media and networking app.

The main goal is to develop social media software that is easier to use and more responsive. It is 
comparable to other social media apps in the market; however, it is much easier to use than other 
apps

### Significance

The project's significance lies in providing users a secure and user-friendly platform to share their 
precious memories. We will build a full-stack web application with the MERN, a powerful and 
popular technology stack [^2].

This project is essential for several reasons:

To give users a platform for sharing and saving their memories: People value their memories, and 
this app will provide users with a platform to share those experiences with others and preserve 
them for the future.
Minimalism: To create a social networking app that is simple to use and free of unnecessary 
features that distract from the application's intended use.

This project includes several distinctive features that set it apart, such as authentication, likes, dark 
mode, and a responsive design. However, rather than being a general-purpose tool, it concentrates 
on a particular use case: sharing and preserving memories. 

Lastly, cutting-edge web development tools have been used to create this web app, such as the MERN stack, a well-liked and full 
technology stack for creating full-stack online applications [^3].

Overall, the project offers a complete social media website built using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. This web app aims to provide users a more personalized, user-friendly, and secure experience. 

Additionally, this web app can be a valuable resource for future developers looking to build their social media websites using the MERN stack.

This web application's distinctive combination of technology and features explains how it differs from other web applications, such as:

Firstly, the MERN stack used to build this app is a popular and powerful combination of technologies that helps developers to create modern and scalable online apps. This guarantees that the app has a solid foundation and is stable and dependable.
Secondly, the app is responsive, allowing it to adjust to various screen sizes and device types. This improves the user experience and makes the software available to a wider range of users.
Thirdly, the app has a number of key features, including authentication, the capability to favorite or like content, and a dark mode setting. These features improve the user experience and offer extra functionality that users might not find in other programs of a similar nature.
Finally, MUI (Material UI) makes it simpler for developers to create a dependable and attractive user interface. This makes sure the app is user-friendly and appealing to the eye.
Overall, this web application stands out from other web apps because of its distinctive combination of technology and features, making it a solid and exciting tool for users. This social platform is also very easy to use and doesn't have any advertising or business features. Hence, It can be used for research on topics like influence, social networks, and similarity in a controlled environment without any interference [^5]

### Objective

The main objective behind developing this social media web application is to build a bridge 
connecting people to facilitate accessible communication and effective social interaction. This 
Social media app will allow people to interact with each other and can be used for sharing news, 
events, wishes, opinions, and various other forms of information. Nowadays, social media apps 
have become the most used applications in our daily lives [^2].

Our application has an interactive and fully responsive UI where you can post updates, including 
pictures or text messages. Any person following us can view our posts, send a like, and comment 
on them. In addition, we can follow any person of our choice and can also unfollow them.
We will use MERN to create the application consisting of Mongoose and Mongo DB for the 
database, React framework for the front end, and Express JS and Node JS for the backend. By 
the end of the development, we will be able to gain sufficient knowledge on building a full-stack 
web application using a single language, i.e., JavaScript.

One of the unique parts of this project is that everything in this project will be implemented from 
scratch. Hence, the objective is to get familiar with the recent tools and technologies and gain 
experience in the full-stack development sector while simultaneously providing Users with a 
unique, easy-to-navigate, clean-looking yet creative social media web app where they can share 
their memories or update their memorable moments or stories. Moreover, users can experience 
this from any device as this web app will be fully responsive and adjusted to any sized device.
We will also construct UML diagrams to design our application and any software development 
life cycle process flow method to develop our project.
